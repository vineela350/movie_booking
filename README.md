# New Project Start

# MovieTheater Application - SMC Movies

## Tech stack

REACTJS, TAILWIND CSS, VITE, NODEJS, EXPRESSJS, PostgreSQL

## Design Choices:

### Why PostgreSQL in a database?

- PostgreSQL supports complex data types and allows for efficient storage and querying of this varied data.
- PostgreSQL is known for its high reliability and data integrity features, which are crucial for your system as it involves financial transactions
- Since APIs require input and output in JSON format, PostgreSQL's robust support for JSON data types is beneficial
- PostgreSQL provides robust mechanisms for error handling and input validation

### Why PERN Stack - Performance and User Interface Rendering

- React JS stands out for its ability to abstract the user interface (UI) layer effectively. As a library, React offers flexibility in constructing applications and organizing code, resulting in enhanced UI rendering and performance when compared to Angular
- Cost Efficiency
  PERN stack applications can be designed to scale horizontally using cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. You can scale your infrastructure as needed to handle increased traffic without significant upfront investments..
- Open Source and Cost-Free
  All components of the PERN stack are open source, meaning there are no licensing fees associated with their usage.

## XP Core Values Maintained by Team

- **Communication** <br> Our team ensured clear and effective communication by defining the project requirements and objectives explicitly. We've established the need for APIs with JSON input and output, error handling, and validation, which promoted a shared understanding of expectations. Regular collaboration among team members was essential to meet the project's goals.

- **Feedback** <br> Through a consistent exchange of feedback, we gained valuable insights, adapted to evolving circumstances, and prevented the recurrence of mistakes, ultimately improving our productivity. Throughout the development journey, we initiated pull requests and deposited our modifications in a separate branch. These adjustments were only integrated into the main branch after securing approval from a fellow team member.

- **Simplicity** <br> Simplicity was a key focus in our approach. We emphasized the adoption of straightforward and efficient solutions. Our code was architected with modularity and reusability in mind, guaranteeing that it remains accessible and adaptable for any future team members. We took care to minimize any code inconsistencies, and we incorporated meaningful comments to enhance code comprehension.
